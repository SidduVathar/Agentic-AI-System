# Agentic-AI-System

Agentic-AI-System is a minimal scaffold for building agentic AI workflows — autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents that accept goals, interact with language models, and perform actions programmatically. Agentic AI refers to systems where AI models plan, decide, and act with less human direction than simple prompt/response tools.

This project includes:

Python integration for LLM API calls (LLM_APICall.py)

Proxy support under llm_proxy/

Dependency tracking (Packages.txt)

A Docker Compose setup (docker-compose.yaml)

Config templates (e.g., Litellm_config.yaml)
